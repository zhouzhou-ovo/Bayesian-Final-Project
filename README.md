The physicochemical properties of white wine directly affect its quality. 

This study develops a classification model to predict white wine quality based on physicochemical data. 

The proposed method combines logistic regression with feature selection techniques and Bayesian analysis to address a binary classification problem. 

Experimental results on a training dataset of 2296 white wine samples and a testing dataset of 984 samples yield prediction accuracies of 72.3% and 71.6%, respectively. 

This work provides a comparison between Frequency and Bayesian approaches, offering insights for improving the fitting of our Bayesian model
